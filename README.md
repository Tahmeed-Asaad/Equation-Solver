## Introduction

This is an android app that can solve four types of mathematical equations. The project targets to build an equation solver that is versatile and can be useful for anyone dealing with mathematical equations.  This group project was built for an undergraduate academic course.

## Features


  *  Can solve linear equations and represent the equations mathematically in their graphical form 
  
  *  Can solve polynomial equations up to 20th degree and represent the equations mathematically in their graphical form 
  
  *  Can solve quadratic equations represent the equations mathematically in their graphical form 
  
  *  Can solve polynomial and quadratic equations which has complex roots 
  
  *  Can solve multiple variable equations
  
 
  
  ## Technologies
  
  * Java
  * Android Studio
